== Getting started

This section provides the basic instructions to install the *Language Workbench* with the language definitions for the challenge, and to run the *Modeling Workbench* with example models conforming to the languages.

endif::included_in_readme[]

=== Setting up the Language Workbench with Questionnaire Language Definitions

Requirements:

* Java 17 or higher
* A GEMOC Studio downloaded from http://gemoc.irisa.fr/pub/studio/gemoc_studio_2024_11_12/

NOTE: This is the version used to develop the languages for the challenge. A more recent version may be available from https://gemoc.org/download.html.

NOTE: Documentation for the GEMOC Studio is available at https://download.eclipse.org/gemoc/docs/nightly/index.html[here^].

* A `git clone` of the challenge repository: https://github.com/gemoc/ql-gemoc-lwb2025
  (This can also be performed directly from within GEMOC Studio.)

Steps:

* Unzip or untar the downloaded GEMOC Studio.
* Start GEMOC Studio.

NOTE: In this context, we refer to this initial workspace as the *Language Workbench*, since it contains the language definitions for the challenge.

* Import all projects contained in the following folders of the cloned repository:
  - `plugins/commons/`
  - `plugins/k3ql/`
  - `plugins/ql/`

TIP: In GEMOC Studio, use _File_ > _Import..._ > _General_ > _Existing Projects into Workspace_, then select each folder above to import all contained projects at once.

=== Setting up the Modeling Workbench to Use the Questionnaire Language

From the Language Workbench instance of GEMOC Studio, a second instance (the *Modeling Workbench*) must be launched where the developed language plugins will be deployed.

Steps:

* In GEMOC Studio, open the menu: _Run_ > _Run Configurations..._
* Under _Eclipse Application_, select _Launch Runtime Eclipse LWB2025_ and click _Run_.

NOTE: This launch configuration is available if the `org.gemoc.ql.k3ql.xdsml` project has been correctly imported.

[NOTE]
====
Although for demonstration purposes we start the Modeling Workbench from the Language Workbench, it is possible to package the DSL for standalone use by end users. 
See: https://download.eclipse.org/gemoc/docs/releases/3.6.0/userguide-lw-deploy-language.html#distribute-language-for-model-designer-section
====

* In the opened Modeling Workbench, import the projects located in the `model_examples/` folder.

=== Model Editing

* Edit the provided models using the textual editor (`*.ql` files).

* Visualize models using the graphical editor by opening the corresponding `*.aird` files associated with the `.ql` files.

=== Model Execution

To execute a model (i.e., to start a questionnaire):

* Open the view `QL Form Browser View`:
  - Menu _Window_ > _Show View_ > _Other_ > _Questionnaire Language_ > _QL Form Browser View_.
* Start the model execution:
  - Menu _Run_ > _Run Configurations..._ > _Executable GEMOC with Java engine_.
  - Use one of the predefined launch configurations for the provided models, or create your own (make sure to activate the `QL Form Browser View` addon in the Engine Addons tab).

This launches the questionnaire execution inside the `QL Form Browser View` and, if available, also triggers graphical animation of the model.

=== Model Debugging

To debug a model (i.e., to start a questionnaire in debug mode):

* Open the Debug perspective:
  - Menu _Window_ > _Perspective_ > _Open Perspective_ > _Debug_.
* Open the view `QL Form Browser View` as described above.
* Start the model in debug mode:
  - Menu _Debug_ > _Debug Configurations..._ > _Executable GEMOC with Java engine_.
  - Use one of the predefined launch configurations or create your own.
