=== Languages

* [x] QL ecore
* [ ] QLS ecore
* [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è TODO Language for use of the coordination implementation

=== Representations

* [ ] QL editors
** [x] QL tree editor
** [x]  QL textual editor
** [ ] QL graphical editor
* [ ] QLS editors
** [ ] QLS tree editor
** [ ] QLS textual editor
** [ ] QLS graphical editor
** [ ] textual support in graphical editor

=== Behavior

==== Common to all behavior implementations

* [ ] data format support
** [x] Boolean
** [x] String
** [x] Integer
** [x] Decimal
** [ ] Date
** [ ] Enum

==== Sequential behavior implementation

* [ ] Conditional show/hide of questions
** [x] base support of conditional question groups
* [ ] Support of computed questions 
** [x] base support of computed questions
** [ ] üöß support of computation dependencies
** [ ] üöß runtime check + warning against cyclic computations 

==== Concurrent behavior implementation

[CAUTION]
====
TO BE DEFINED probably something on the computed questions
====

==== Language Coordination implementation

[CAUTION]
====
TO BE DEFINED need to identify a complementary language to be coordinated that can be relevant in this contest.
====


=== Static checkers

* [ ] static type checking of expression
** [ ] static type checking of guards
** [ ] static type checking of computed questions
* [ ] static check of guard cyclic dependencies 
* [ ] static check of computation cyclic dependencies
* [ ] static check of guard determinism (cf. https://github.com/judithmichael/lwb25/blob/main/ChallengeTask.pdf)
* [ ] static check of QLS to prevent multiple presentation of the same question in different groups (pb doesn't occur in basic UI)

=== Runtime base UI

* [ ] üöß Simple web form as GEMOC Engine Add-on
** [x] support for field show/hide during interpretation
** [x] support for read field input to interpreter 
** [x] support for write field from interpreter model to UI field
** [x] support for write field from interpreter model to UI field
** [ ] support for Submit
*** [x] enable/disable submit button if mandatory questions aren't answered
*** [x] serialize answers as xmi (ie. both answers and questions definitions)
*** [ ] custom answer serialization (ie. only answers in a format to be defined (json, csv, or whatever)
** [ ] support for computed questions (must not be editable by the user)
** [ ] data format support
*** [x] Boolean
*** [x] String
*** [x] Integer
*** [x] Decimal
*** [ ] Date
*** [ ] Enum
** [ ] feedback on incorrect data format

=== Runtime advanced UI

* [ ] Web form with Styling
** [ ] Field styling
*** [ ] Boolean (checkbox / Radio)
*** [ ] String (single line /  multiline ) 
*** [ ] Integer (simple text area/ text area + updown / slider )
*** [ ] Decimal (simple text area/ text area + updown / slider )
*** [ ] Date
*** [ ] Enum
** [ ] Group styling/layout
*** [ ] Field groups
*** [ ] Page groups
