It implements the Questionnaire Language (QL) of the challenge defined in https://github.com/judithmichael/lwb25

This repository will hopefully contain 3 different implementations:

* [ ]ðŸš§  An implementation using Gemoc sequential engine (K3-based)
* [ ] An implementation using Gemoc Conccurrent engine (Moccml-based) (partly reusing code from the sequential implementation)
* [ ] An implementation using Gemoc coordination BCool (partly reuse of the moccml-based implementation)
